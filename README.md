First Version: Without Polymorphism

In the first version of my calculator, I wrote methods that only worked for a single type of input (for example, double only).
This meant the calculator was limited . when i press 2 + 2 = 4 , instead of 4, it gives me 4.0, 

so now in Aptech class i learnt polymorphism on Tuesday, i understond how compile- time in polymorphism works 
i heard to improve it.
With this approach, I used the same method names for different parameter types.
This allowed the calculator to handle both integers and decimal numbers more efficiently.

Why Compile-Time Polymorphism?
1:It makes the program more flexible and reusable.
2:It keeps the code cleaner since I donâ€™t need to write multiple differently-named methods for each data type.
3:It shows how Java decides which method to call at compile time, based on the type of data provided.

so i have method for int and double so the system will know wen to print double or int.

so check out the code and see for your self.
